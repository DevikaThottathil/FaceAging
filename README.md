Face Aging using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)


This repository contains code and resources for face aging research using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). The goal of this project is to develop and explore techniques for accurately predicting and synthesizing facial age progression and regression.

Introduction
Face aging is an important area of research with applications in various domains including law enforcement, entertainment, and personal identification. With recent advancements in deep learning, particularly in the field of generative models, it has become possible to generate realistic facial images depicting the aging process.
